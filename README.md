# Android Audio Frequency generator

This app creates a sine wave at any audible frequency.  
Designed to be an ad free open source alternative to frequency generator apps.  

Tested with an oscilloscope to produce accurate output.  
Assumes 44.1kHz sample rate.  
Note that the sound is played for 60 seconds at a time.  
Changing the duration value increases the audio buffer lenght and will cause the app to crash if set too high.  

This is my first android app so expect spaghetti code.
